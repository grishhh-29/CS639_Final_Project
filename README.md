App Name - BalanceBliss 

1. Problem Statement 

The problem we aim to address revolves around promoting healthier lifestyle choices and overall well-being. Through research, it's evident that modern lifestyles often lead to poor dietary habits, lack of physical activity, and increased stress levels. This can contribute to various health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health disorders. Our solution aims to tackle these issues by providing tools and resources to help individuals manage their diet, track their calorie intake, and incorporate meditation practices into their daily lives.

2. Target Users - Persona 

Our target users encompass a diverse range of individuals seeking to improve their health and well-being. Let's meet one of our personas: 

Persona: Alex 

Age: 20 
Occupation: College Student 
Lifestyle: Alex is a busy college student juggling classes, assignments, and extracurricular activities. They often find it challenging to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to limited time and resources.
Goals: Alex aims to adopt healthier eating habits, manage their weight, and reduce stress levels to improve academic performance and overall well-being.
Technology Usage: Alex is tech-savvy and relies heavily on their smartphone for various tasks, including studying, communication, and entertainment.

3. Major Features 
Our solution comprises three main functionalities: 

Diet Planner: Allows users to plan and track their meals, set dietary goals, and receive personalized recommendations based on their nutritional needs and preferences.

Calorie Tracker: Enables users to log their daily calorie intake, view nutritional information for various foods, and monitor their progress towards achieving their weight management goals.

Calm (Meditation Related): Provides guided meditation sessions, breathing exercises, and mindfulness activities to help users alleviate stress, improve focus, and enhance overall mental well-being. 

4. Uniqueness & Market Comparison 

Our solution stands out due to its comprehensive approach towards promoting holistic health and well-being. While there are existing solutions in the market addressing individual aspects such as diet tracking, calorie counting, or meditation, our platform integrates these functionalities into a seamless user experience.

Three solutions similar or related to ours in the Google Play Store include: 

Spoonacular: A popular app for tracking food intake and exercise, but lacks comprehensive meditation features. 

Calm: Offers meditation and mindfulness exercises, but does not include diet planning or calorie tracking features. 

Lifesum: Provides diet tracking and meal planning features, but does not focus extensively on meditation and mindfulness practices. 

Our solution combines the best elements of these existing apps while offering a unique blend of diet planning, calorie tracking, and meditation features in one platform.
